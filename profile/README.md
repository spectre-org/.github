## Preamble

If you've used the excellent [Spectre](https://github.com/picturepan2/spectre) CSS library created by [@picturepan2](https://github.com/picturepan2) you're probably a huge fan of its aesthetic, typography, components, customisation options and general approach.

Unfortunately, after several years of stagnation and inactivity, the project seems to be dead:

- the last release was in [July 2020](https://github.com/picturepan2/spectre/releases) 
- there are 30 [pull requests](https://github.com/picturepan2/spectre/pulls) outstanding
- there are 164 [issues](https://github.com/picturepan2/spectre/issues) unresolved
- there is an unreleased [0.5.10 branch](https://github.com/picturepan2/spectre/tree/0.5.10) from October 2020
- the last comment from [@picturepan](https://github.com/picturepan2) was in [September 2020](https://github.com/picturepan2/spectre/issues/643)

For such a well-designed and useful framework, this is a real shame; not only will the project not get bug fixes, but it also won't get updates and new features which keep it a viable option going forwards in a fast-paced web world.

## Aims

As Spectre's code is MIT Licensed, this organisation has been created with the aim of:

- keeping the Spectre CSS project alive
- merging outstanding pull requests
- publishing new releases
- fixing future bugs
- creating complimentary projects (such as [Spectre Vue](https://github.com/spectre-org/spectre-vue))

A discussion about these aims has been started [here](https://github.com/spectre-org/spectre-css/discussions/2), and you are encouraged to participate!

You may review the checklist there, as well as check out:

- [Spectre CSS issues](https://github.com/spectre-org/spectre-css/issues)
- [Spectre CSS documentation](https://spectre-org.github.io/spectre-docs/)
- [Spectre Org repositories](https://github.com/orgs/spectre-org/repositories)

## Naming

To avoid confusion, note:

- The new framework name is Spectre CSS; the original is Spectre.css
- The new package name is `spectre-css` (with a dash); the original is `spectre.css` (with a dot)
